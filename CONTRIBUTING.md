Guidelines
==========

Contributions to `earthpy` are welcome. They are more likely to
be accepted if they follow the guidelines below.

At this stage of development, we are developing a set of
usable wrapper functions that help make working with earth
systems data easier. We are open to new functionality but are currently
trying to ensure our package is stable, operational and well documented.

Edits & Updates
===============

When submitting a change to the repository, please do the following:

- Please first create an issue that covers the item that you'd like to change, update or enhance. Once a discussion has yielded a vote of support for that addition to the package, you are ready to submit a pull request.

When submitting a pull request:

- All existing tests should pass. Please make sure that the test
  suite passes, both locally and on
  [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/earthlab/earthpy). Status on
  Travis will be visible on a pull request. If you want to enable
  Travis CI on your own fork, please read the
  [getting started docs](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/).

- New functionality should include tests. Please write reasonable
  tests for your code and make sure that they pass on your pull request.

- Classes, methods, functions, etc. should have docstrings. The first
  line of a docstring should be a standalone summary. Parameters and
  return values should be documented explicitly.

- Please note that tests are also run via Travis-CI on our documentation. So be sure that any ``.rst` file submissions are properly formatted and tests are passing!

Documentation Updates
=====================

Improving the documentation and testing for code already in `earthpy`
is a great way to get started if you'd like to make a contribution. Please note
that our documentation files are in [`ReStructuredText (.rst)`](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format and format your pull request
accordingly.

Style
-----

- `Earthpy` currently only supports python 3 (3.2+). Please test code locally in
python 3 when
  possible (all supported versions will be automatically tested on
  Travis CI).

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) when possible. Some standards that we follow include:
    - The first word of a comment should be capitalized with a space   following the `#` sign like this: `# This is a comment here`
    - Variable and function names should be all lowercase with words separated by `_`.
    - Class definitions should use camel case - example: `ClassNameHere` .

- Imports should be grouped with standard library imports first,
  3rd-party libraries next, and `earthpy` imports third following PEP 8 standards.
  Within each grouping, imports should be alphabetized. Always use absolute
  imports when possible, and explicit relative imports for local
  imports when necessary in tests.
