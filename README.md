# EarthPy

A package built to support python teaching in the Earth Lab earth analytics program
at University of Colorado, Boulder.

## Install

To install, use pip. `--upgrade` is optional but it ensures that the package overwrites
when you install and you have the current version. If you don't have the package
yet you can still use the `--upgrade` argument.

`pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/earthlab/earthpy.git`

Then import it into python.

`import earthpy as et`
