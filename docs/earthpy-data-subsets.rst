EarthPy Data Subsets
=====================

EarthPy comes with the ability to download example datasets using the
``earthpy.data.get_data()`` function. These datasets are used in example
documentation on how to use EarthPy as well as in the EarthPy related
lessons on https://www.earthdatascience.org, the open learning portal developed
and maintained by Earth Lab at CU Boulder. To download these datasets, you can
provide the appropriate data key to the ``earthpy.data.get.data()`` function
for one of the datasets listed below
(e.g.. ``earthpy.data.get_data("colorado-flood")``).

Data Keys
=========

colorado-flood
--------------

This dataset contains `data from the 2013 Colorado Flood <https://figshare.com/articles/Earth_Analytics_Python_Colorado_Flood_Teaching_Subset/6815945>`_.
The files include river discharge data from Boulder Creek at North 75th St. near Boulder,
CO., collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) on the 5th of October, 2016. Additionally,
there is daily precipitation data collected by the USGS near Boulder, CO., which was
collected from 2003-2013. Finally, there are digital elevation models (DEMs) stored
in this dataset, collected near Boulder. The data for these DEMs were acquired by the
National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) during fortuitous test flights before
and after the 2013 Colorado Floods. Digital terrain models (DTMs) and digital surface
models (DSMs) were generated by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform data processing
team. Hillshades and the clip-extent were generated by Leah Wasser at Earth Lab - University
of Colorado Boulder.

co-flood-extras
---------------

This dataset contains two supplemental CSV files for the 2013 Colorado Flood
data. The files include `precipitation <https://figshare.com/articles/CO_Flood_2013_-_Classroom_Lab/4295360>`_
for August 21, 2013 to October 11, 2013 in Boulder, Colorado as well as an
example of `temperature data <https://figshare.com/articles/Week_2_earth_analytics/4502138>`_
that includes both null and nodata values for use in a data cleaning process.

spatial-vector-lidar
--------------------

This dataset contains `vector and Lidar data <https://figshare.com/articles/Week_4_Earth_Analytics_teaching_data_subset_-_lidar_and_insitu_for_California/4620268>`_
This includes a subset of spatial data for the California Madera County
and NEON Soaproot Saddle (SOAP) and San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) sites
in California. There are also some other general spatial boundary layers from
natural earth, including global roads, political boundaries, and populated
places. Finally, there are NEON Lidar data and insitu measurements for
SOAP and SJER sites.

cold-springs-modis-h4
---------------------

This dataset contains imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
`(MODIS)    <https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/multispectral-remote-sensing-modis/modis-remote-sensing-data-in-python/>`_
maintained by NASA. `The satellite data <https://figshare.com/articles/Earth_Analytics_Cold_Springs_Fire_Remote_Sensing_Data/6083210>`_
are for the 2016 Cold Springs fire near Nederland, CO. and are in h4 format.

cold-springs-fire
-----------------

This dataset contains satellite and vector data for the
`2016 Cold Springs fire near Nederland, CO <https://figshare.com/articles/Earth_Analytics_Cold_Springs_Fire_Remote_Sensing_Data/6083210>`_.
The imagery used for this dataset comes from MODIS, National Agriculture
Imagery Program `(NAIP) <https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/intro-naip/>`_
(provided by the US Department of Agriculture), and
Land-Use Satellite `(Landsat) <https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/multispectral-remote-sensing-in-python/landsat-bands-geotif-in-Python/>`_
(provided by the USGS).

------------

NAIP imagery related to the 2016 Cold Springs fire near Nederland, CO.

cs-test-landsat
---------------

Landsat imagery related to the 2016 Cold Springs fire near Nederland, CO.

ndvi-automation
---------------

This dataset includes `Landsat imagery and vector files <https://figshare.com/articles/Earth_Analytics_Python_HOMEWORK_Landsat_8_2017_for_SJER_and_HARV_Download_from_Earth_Explorer/7272500>`_
for the SJER and SOAP NEON sites.

vignette-landsat
----------------

Landsat imagery used in the vignette `gallery <https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/index.html>`_
related to the 2016 Cold Springs fire near Nederland, CO.

vignette-elevation
------------------

Elevation data used in the vignette `gallery <https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery_vignettes/index.html>`_
related to the 2013 Colorado floods near Boulder, CO.

california-rim-fire
-------------------

This dataset contains vector and raster data for the `2013 Rim Fire in California <https://figshare.com/articles/Earth_Analytics_Applications_Data_for_Rim_Fire_California_2013/7749548>`_.
The raster data have been cropped using the fire perimeter boundary provided
by Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS). The data are products from various
sources including MTBS, Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (GeoMAC),
MODIS Active Fire, MODIS Burned Area, and Incident Status Summary
(ICS 209) reports.
